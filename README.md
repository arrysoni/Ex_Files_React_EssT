# My React Project

This project was built as practice for the LinkedIn Learning certification course:  
**React Essential Training** — specifically the module **“Designing performant apps with React Server Components”**, taught by **Eve Porcello** :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.

---

## 🚀 Course Synopsis

In this course, Eve Porcello introduces the latest techniques for building a React app from scratch—covering:

- Creating elements & writing React components  
- Using modern React hooks (`useState`, `useReducer`, `useEffect`)  
- Setting up projects with **Vite** and **Next.js**  
- Understanding **React Server Components** vs. **Client Components**  
- Employing tools, patterns, and frameworks to future‑proof apps and enhance scalability and performance :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

By the end, you’ll be equipped to start your own project or contribute effectively to an existing React codebase.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing the course and this project, you will be able to:

1. Develop dynamic UIs using React components, JSX syntax, and props  
2. Use `useState` and `useReducer` for managing component state effectively  
3. Implement side effects with the `useEffect` hook  
4. Initialize and configure React projects using Vite and Next.js  
5. Create and navigate file‑based routing in Next.js (SSR & static generation)  
6. Fetch and render data asynchronously from REST APIs  
7. Design and implement server‑side form actions and data mutations in Next.js  
8. Build responsive interfaces with **Tailwind CSS**  
9. Optimize rendering by distinguishing Server Components from Client Components in Next.js  
10. Apply advanced Next.js features—caching, React Server Components, and data storage strategies
